This is a number guesser game that takes the users input or "user guess" which is a value between zero and nine and a number generated by the computer which follows the same conditions and compares it to another random target number generated. The value closest to the target number wins and a point is added to their respective score. If the value entered by the user is above nine or below zero there will be an alert message.
